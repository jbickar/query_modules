Working Draft

This project is very much still a working draft.  Here is a list of known areas for improvement:

Installation

It sounds like most Linux machines come with whiptail.  If you are using a Mac, try:

`brew install newt`

Which contains whiptail.  then run:

`./query_modules.sh`

From the delete_modules directory.
